Consumer app api is a part of a large platform that supports requests from web, mobile, and third-party services. 
The whole platform consists of 21 microservices, each with its own logical responsibility, and they are designed to scale independently. 
The architecture, code structure, and practices of each microservice are consistent, 
which helps with maintainability and development. The entire ecosystem is hosted on AWS and orchestrated by Kubernetes, 
with Docker used for containerization and CircleCI for continuous integration and delivery. 
Overall, the platform is robust and flexible, with a focus on scalability, reliability, and security.
